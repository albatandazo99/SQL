# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle. Created a table to insert Spotify data into. Then performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#After creating the table, I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 
SELECT artist_name, 
track_name,
avg(popularity), 
avg(danceability),
avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#Then I determined the top 10 popular artists based on popularity and included the danceability. 
SELECT track_name, artist_name, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#I found which artist released the loudest song. 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, loudness
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY loudness DESC
LIMIT 1;

#I also determined which artist released the longest song. 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

#Then I labelled the songs as high energy, average energy, and low energy based on the energy of the song. The energy of a song: the higher the value, the more energtic the song is. 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, danceability, loudness, tempo,
    CASE 
    WHEN energy > 0.64 THEN "high energy"
    WHEN energy >= 0.45 THEN "average energy"
    else "low energy"
    END as "energy_label"
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY energy_label, artist_name;
