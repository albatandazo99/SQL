#For this project, I downloaded a digital media store database that consisted of tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers. After I downloaded the database, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 


#1. Show customers who are in the US only. 
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country ='USA';

#2. Show only the customers in California.
SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, State, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE State = 'CA';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from California.
SELECT cust.CustomerId, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingState
FROM chinook.customers AS cust
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices aASinv
ON cust.CustomerId=inv.CustomerId
WHERE inv.BillingState ='CA';

#4. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#5. Which country had the highest sales in 2009?
SELECT BillingCountry, ROUND(SUM(total),1) AS Total
FROM chinook.invoices
GROUP BY BillingCountry
ORDER BY Total DESC LIMIT 1;

#6. How many invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';

#7. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT ROUND(sum(total),1)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';

#8. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT inv.InvoiceLineId AS Invoice_Line_Id, 
t.Name AS Track_Name, 
artist.Name AS Artist_name
FROM chinook.invoice_items AS inv

LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks AS t ON inv.TrackId = t.TrackId 
INNER JOIN chinook.albums AS a ON a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists AS artist ON artist.ArtistId = a.ArtistId;

#9. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.Name AS Track_Name, a.Title AS Album_Name, 
m.Name AS Media_Type, g.Name AS Genre
FROM chinook.tracks AS t
LEFT JOIN chinook.albums AS a ON t.AlbumId = a.AlbumId
LEFT JOIN chinook.media_types AS m ON m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
LEFT JOIN chinook.genres AS g ON g.GenreId = t.GenreId;

#10. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT emp.EmployeeId, emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, 
ROUND(SUM(inv.Total),1) AS Total_Sales
FROM chinook.customers AS cust

JOIN chinook.employees AS emp ON cust.SupportRepId=emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv ON inv.CustomerId=cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY emp.EmployeeId;

#11. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT emp.EmployeeId, emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(inv.Total),1) as Total_Sales
FROM chinook.customers AS cust

JOIN chinook.employees AS emp ON cust.SupportRepId=emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv ON inv.CustomerId=cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND inv.InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'

GROUP BY emp.EmployeeId
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC LIMIT 1;
